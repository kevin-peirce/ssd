# ssd
This is SSD application that runs the bank and stockmarket.

Basic installation steps, it assumes that MySQL and Apache Tomcat have already been installed (and if on linux MySQL has been set to "case insenstive" mode).

1. Check MySQL and Apache Tomcat are running.
2. Go into the mysql folder (in git)
3. Run the "mysql_schema" script
4. Run the "mytable tbale ddl" script.

That should have MySQL running with the schema all setup.

5. Go into the Tomcat manager and deploy the WAR file
